    <h2><b>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE</b> </h2>
    <P class="one"> In November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For years, I
        had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with habits and I was
        finally ready to share some of them publicly. I began by publishing a new article
        every Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led
        to my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number
        had grown to more than thirty thousand people.</P>
    <p class="two">In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand subscribers,
        which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the internet. I had felt
        like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was
        becoming known as an expert on habitsâ€”a new label that excited me but also
        felt uncomfortable. I had never considered myself a master of the topic, but
        rather someone who was experimenting alongside my readers.
